            Robot Ceres, the second robot designed for the "Into the Deep"
            season, was built to meet all the competition's challenges with
            precision and efficiency. Its innovative features, including an
            advanced Intake-Outtake system and a robust climbing mechanism,
            enable it to perform complex tasks such as collecting and scoring
            game elements in both Low and High Baskets, as well as placing
            specimens in Chambers.

          <br />
          <p className="opacity-80 text-[1rem] font-black">
            The Intake-Outtake system allows Ceres to efficiently collect
            samples from the Submersible, game field, and Observation Zone. A
            tilting mechanism was chosen for transferring elements from the
            front to the back of the robot, balancing complexity with
            efficiency. This approach minimizes synchronization issues while
            ensuring precise handling of game pieces.
