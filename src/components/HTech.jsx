          <p className="opacity-80 text-[1rem] font-black">
            On November 2, 2024, our team had the honor of participating in the
            first demonstration event of the IntoTheDeep season, organized by
            the h-tech team at "Ion CreangÄƒ" National College in Bucharest. This
            well-organized event brought together talented teams from the FTC
            community and provided the perfect setting to test strategies, learn
            from interactions with others, and explore the potential of the
            current season.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="opacity-80 text-[1rem] font-black">
            The event was structured to highlight both the competitive and
            educational aspects, with each match offering opportunities for
            innovation and reflection. During the demonstration matches, our
            team achieved a new record of 210 points, a significant
            accomplishment that secured us second place in the competition
            standings. These results motivated us to face future challenges with
            confidence and focus on optimizing our strategies.

            collaborative atmosphere and mutual support among participants
            contributed to a memorable experience. We were thrilled to discover
            new approaches, discuss innovative technical solutions, and enjoy
