            On November 24, 2024, our team participated in the first League Meet
            of the IntoTheDeep season, held in Ploie»ôti, within the City Hall of
            the municipality, in the SUD Region. The event was organized by the
            Ro2D2 Team and Info1 Robotics, providing an excellent setting for
            competition and interaction. Additionally, we had the opportunity to
            visit the stands of FLL teams such as Info1 Junior, Info1 Lite,
            Ro2D2 Junior, and Plex Robotics, discovering inspiring projects.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="opacity-80 text-[1rem] font-black">
            During the competition, we achieved an outstanding performance,
            winning five matches and setting a new national and international
            record of 278 points in partnership with the High Five Robotics
            team. At the end of the event, we secured second place in both the
            League Rank and the competition standings. The biggest surprise came
            when we were ranked 5th worldwide in the Offensive Power Ranking
            (OPR).
